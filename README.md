# Customer-Churn-Prediction-in-Telecom-Using-Machine-Learning
Predicting customer churn for telecom companies using machine learning models.

📊 Project Overview
Analyzes telecom customer data to predict churn using multiple ML algorithms:

Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Bagging, XGBoost, Naive Bayes

Best performing: Random Forest with SMOTE+ENN balancing (~90%+ accuracy)

🛠️ Features
Data cleaning & preprocessing

One-hot encoding for categorical features

SMOTE+ENN for handling class imbalance

Model comparison with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

Streamlit web interface for predictions
🚀 Usage
Analysis: Run churn_prediction.ipynb to see model comparisons

Prediction: Use app.py for new customer predictions via web interface
